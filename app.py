    Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Mark Kenneth Badilla, a fourth-year BSIT student at Cebu Institute of Technology - University, where my curiosity in technology has blossomed into a profound passion. From tinkering with my first computer to mastering complex software development, my journey is defined by relentless learning and a drive to solve real-world problems.

    With certifications like the TESDA NC-II in Computer Systems Servicing and practical experience from Kaggle competitions, I've honed skills that blend technical precision with strategic insight. My projects often merge technology with user experience, focusing on developing intuitive and impactful solutions in Android and web platforms.

    Active participation in the Computer Students Society and the Google Developer Student Club has enriched my network and fueled my enthusiasm for collaborative innovation. As I near graduation, I'm excited about contributing to transformative projects that leverage technology to improve lives.

    Thanks for stopping by, and I'm looking forward to connecting and collaborating with fellow tech enthusiasts!
